## Puzzles
In main.py, I have commented out some starting code for these puzzles. <br />
Write your code in these sections and uncomment them. <br />
I have provided some examples of similar functions to what each puzzle is asking for. Learn to read the code and modify it. <br />

At the very bottom, I have listed the functions. Comment and uncomment them, to run them one at a time.

```
# Run the puzzles

    example_a()
    #puzzle_a()

    example_b()
    #puzzle_b()

    example_c()
    #puzzle_c()
```

### A -  Your favourite color
Write a program that asks for your favourite color. <br />
It should output "Your favourite color is " and then their fav color <br />
Use String Interpolation to print the answer, not string concatenation as shown above. <br />
There are three types, f'blah blah blah {var}' and .format() and %s <br />


### B - I was too sick to do my homework
Write a program that displays the message "I was too sick to do my homework." <br />
Then display this same message in all capitals (uppercase). <br />
Use string interpolation again, not concatenation as shown in Example B. <br />


### C â€“ Folder Names
Ask the user to input a folder name <br />
Then ask the user to input a file name <br />
Display the file path "C:\{folderName}\{fileName}.txt" using the user's inputs <br />
You will need to learn how to escape the backslash characters or use raw strings. <br />


# Good Luck!
